    "2. **Explain the difference between mutually exclusive and independence.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Mutually exclusive means the occurrence of one event precludes the others\n",
    "   - Independence means there is no relationship between the occurrences of the events\n",
    "   - Hence mutually exclusive events are not independent and vice versa\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Explain what a p-value is ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - How **unlikely** it is to observe **a value as or more extreme that X given the null hypothesis is correct**\n",
    "   - **If the $\\mu = 7$:** \n",
    "     - Probability of observing 10000 or more is small\n",
    "     - Probability of observing 8 or more is much higher\n",

    "4. **Compute the variance of the following population: `10, 12, 34, 24`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - $\\bar{X} = \\frac{10+12+34+24}{4} = 20$\n",
    "   - $Var(X) = \\frac{(10-20)^2 + (12-20)^2 + (34-20)^2 + (24-20)^2}{4} = 94$\n",

    "5. **How would you prove if a coin is unfair ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Let $X$ be the number of heads when flip 1000 times\n",
    "     $$X \\sim Binomial(n=1000, p=0.5)$$\n",
    "   - The mean ($mu$) is $1000(0.5) = 500$\n",
    "   - The standard deviation ($sigma$) is $\\sqrt{1000(0.5)(0.5)} = \\sqrt{250}$\n",
    "   \n",
    "     <br>\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - By CLT:\n",

    "   - Compute p-value of observing $H$:\n",
    "     $$p = 1 - cdf(Z)$$\n",

    "     <br>\n",
    "     \n",
    "     If $p < 0.05 /2$ (two-tailed), then null ($\\mu$=500) is rejected and coin is unfair\n",
    "     \n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Explain what the standard error of mean is.** \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean \n",
    "   - Given we have estimated the population mean ($\\mu$) from a sample mean ($\\bar{X}$)\n",
    "   - There is a distribution of sample means we could have observed given a certain population\n",
    "   - We can computer the standard error as such:\n",
    "    \n",
    "     $$SE = \\frac{\\text{sample SD}}{\\sqrt{\\text{sample size}}} $$\n",
    "   - The smaller the sample SD or the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error is\n",
    "\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. **What is a confidence interval and what does it represents ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A 95% confidence interval means we are 95% confident that the interval include the population statistics\n",
    "   - Meaning if 100 samples are drawn and 100 confidence intervals are computed, 95 will contain the population statistic and 5 would not\n",
    "  \n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **How do you calculate the 95% confidence interval of a sample mean ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Given a large enough sample size (>30), the sampling distribution of the mean will converge to a normal distribution (Central Limit Theorem)\n",
    "   - 95% CI translates to $\\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{standard error of sample mean}$\n",
    "\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Describe the 2 ways to decide the parameters for the given distribution that best fit the dataset ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Method of Moment (MOM):**\n",
    "   \n",
    "     - Estimate the population statistics from the sample statistics (mean, variance...) and computer paramters for distribution\n",
    "     \n",
    "     <br>\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - **Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE):**\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - Compute the likelihood of observing all the data points given certain distribution paramters (product of the PMF / PDF of all the data points) \n",
    "     - Select the paramters that yields the highest likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Describe the central limit theorem. As a data scientist, state a few scenarios where you cannot use the CLT.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of independent random variables, each with a well-defined expected value and well-defined variance, will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution\n",
    "    - **Cannot use CLT if:**\n",
    "      - Sampling is not random\n",
    "      - Underlying distribution does not have define mean / variance (power law distribution)\n",
    "      - The statistic is not arithmetic mean (median / variance ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Describe what statistical power is. Illustrate the concept with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The ability to reject the null hypothesis given the alternative hypothesis is true\n",
    "    - i.e. Probability of false negative\n",
    "    - The test is not _powerful_ enough if the effect size we are trying to detect is small, i.e. the alternative hypothesis is very similar to the null\n",
    "    - Or the sample size is small, i.e. we do not have a large enough sample size (too little evidence) to reject the null\n",
    "\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "12. **What is the difference of using the mean vs the median as a centrality measure ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Median does not account for the values at the tails (smallest and largest) values of the distribution \n",
    "    - Hence median is more insensitive to extreme values / outliers\n",
    "    - Often times the arithmetic mean does not sufficiently inform us of the distribution of data\n",
    "    - 25%, 50% (median), 75% quantiles, variance and skewness can inform us more about the distribution of values\n",
    "\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "13. **Given you have a significance level of 0.05 and you have ran 20 independent comparison (t-test) without correcting your significance level, what is your effective rate of false positive ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 0.05 signifance level represents a tolerence of 5% false positive rate for each test, therefore 95% non-false positive\n",
    "     \n",
    "      $$1 - (0.95)^{20} = 0.64$$"
