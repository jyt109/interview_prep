    "# Data Science Interviews\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are 3 rounds of interviews before a company would give you an offer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Take-home (Maybe)**\n",
    "2. **Recruiter Phone Interview**\n",
    "3. **Technical Phone Interview**\n",
    "4. **Onsite Interview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some variants include the first round being a technical interview or multiple onsite interviews in rare cases or multiple rounds of technical phone interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically between each stage you have a couple of days to 3 weeks gaps. The expected waiting time between stages is closer to 1 week.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The whole process usually take from 3 to 6 weeks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Take-home\n",
    "\n",
    "It is paramount that you ace your take-home if you decide to do the take-home. Acing the take-home would make the technical interviews down the road easier and more just about explaining what your have done for the take-home. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**To ace the take-home:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Offer extra insight / knowledge that is not being asked\n",
    "- Figure out the main theme behind the assignment and add your own interpretation to the assignment\n",
    "- Push your code to a private Github repo (\\$7 a month) and make it object oriented and PEP8 compliant \n",
    "- Write a `readme.md` explaining what your have done, reasoning behind and what you could have done\n",
    "- Alternatively write a presentation (especially if asked to) and have it up on the repo as well\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recruiter Phone Interview\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of you would pass if you have spent more than an hour preparing. You should always ask if the phone interview is technical or not. If not, then most likely it would be a recruiter interview, otherwise see technical phone interview below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**To pass the interview, you should:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the job description and make sure you understand it\n",
    "- **Be able talk through your resume chrnologically, from college to present**\n",
    "- **Focus on the relevant data science experience in broad strokes**\n",
    "- Do not focus on technical details \n",
    "- **Important: Get an idea what the team does. If the recruiter does not know, then at least try to get the name of some one on the team, ideally the person who will be doing your technical interview**\n",
    "- Also always ask when you are going to hear back\n",
    "- If you are asked about if X to Y salary range is ok, do not say yes / no, unless it is very significantly less than what you have expected. Say it depends on other things and it is still to early to tell this is a good range\n",

    "## Technical Phone Interview\n",
    "\n",
    "This round varies from company to company, **almost all companies will do a coding screen**. This round would be done by a data scientist or a software engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you have the name of the interviewer, google / linkedin that person to find out his background.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**That will tell you what he/she knows and what he/she might ask.**  \n",

    "- **Coding screen**\n",
    "  - Basic algorithms in sorting and searching, similar to the anagrams question\n",

    "  - Counting permutations and combination problems, given 5 coin flip, probability of observing at least 1 head\n",
    "  - Distribution question, usually Poisson, Binomial or Exponential\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product question**\n",
    "  - How would you make suggestions about what we should change in the company\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Machine learning question**\n",
    "  - Mostly logistic / linear regression at this stage unless you are going for specialist or machine learning engineer role (More specific questions in another notebook)\n",
    " \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Onsite Interview\n",
    "Most often that would be the last round. In addition to your technical skills, you have a be a cultural fit, i.e. they have to like working with you.\n",

    "- Maybe 1 software engineer. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content-wise, it will be the same as the technical phone screeen, except**\n",
    "- **More in depth questions**\n",
    "  - **Coding:** Use of Stack and Queues / Recursion problems / Dynamic programming (Very rare)\n",
    "  - **ML:** Details of logistic / linear, RF, SVM, Naive Bayes \n",
    "  - **Stats:** Statistical Power, Multiple Testing corrections, Bootstrapping\n",
    "  - **Behvaioral:** Team work, your weakness and strength, what can you improve on\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",

    "  - What assumptions are you making ?\n",

    "- Vocalize almost every thought you have\n",
    "- Scale down the problem to something you can count and simulate (from like 100 to 10)\n",
    "- Get feedback before you try to go down one path too far\n",
    "  - Slience from the interviewer is also a form of feedback (probably wrong...)\n",
    "- **Try thinking about:**\n",
    "  - **Sorting**\n",
    "  - **Dividing in the middle and search (Binary Search)**\n",
    "  - **Break down into repeated tasks and do recursion**\n"
